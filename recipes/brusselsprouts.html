        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Brussels sprouts are yummy and healthy. Yummy because of oil and salt, and healthy because of being a veggie. The brussel sprouts adds a nice bit of stank to the oil and salt.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 pounds of Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat. Pour onto a baking sheet, and place in center oven rack.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.</li>
