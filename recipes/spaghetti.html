        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a recipe I found from a quick Google search. Looks good, but who knows? Spaghetti meets pie. Why the heck not!?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion, divided</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic salt, divided</li>
                <li>1 1/2 sticks butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
            </ul>

Sprinkle half the cracker crumbs, half the parmesan cheese, half the parsley, half the minced onion, and half the garlic salt on top. Pour in half of the melted butter. Repeat with remaining spaghetti, cracker crumbs, parmesan cheese, parsley, minced onion, garlic salt, and butter.</li>
                <li>Mix milk and eggs together in a bowl. Pour over the spaghetti mixture.</li>
